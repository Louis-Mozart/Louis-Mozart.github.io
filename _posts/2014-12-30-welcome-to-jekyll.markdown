Welcome to my webpage! Here, you can learn about my research activities, projects, and contributions. I’m pursuing a PhD with a focus on **Class Expression Learning with Multiple Representations**, and I’ve been actively working on cutting-edge topics like knowledge graph embeddings, ontology-based retrieval, and caching algorithms.

### Current Projects

#### 2. **Instance Retrieval with Embedding-Based Reasoners**
A project leveraging embeddings to optimize retrieval in OWL ontologies. It integrates subsumption-based caching and Jaccard similarity calculations to improve efficiency.

#### 1. **Embedding-in-Function-Spaces**
This is my latest repository, where I explore embedding techniques in function spaces to enhance reasoning and retrieval capabilities.  
GitHub Repository: [Embedding-in-function-spaces](https://github.com/Louis-Mozart/Embedding-in-function-spaces)


#### 3. **Knowledge Graph Embedding Models**
I have developed two knowledge graph embedding models, with both models accepted in academic venues. These models provide a foundation for ontology representation learning.

### Research Activities

- **Ontology Instance Retrieval**: Developing algorithms for efficient instance retrieval using reasoning and embeddings.
- **Subsumption-Based Caching**: Implementing caching strategies for ontology instance retrieval, focusing on LIFO purging and similarity-based assessments.
- **Class Expression Learning**: Exploring methods for representing and learning complex OWL class expressions with multiple representations.
- **Mutagenesis Data Analysis**: Integrating Web Ontology Language (OWL) constructs with biological data for improved inference.

### Collaboration and Updates

I’m actively collaborating on **WP4** of a funded project. A recent deliverable included providing updates on **PCDP** changes. If you're interested in updates, feel free to reach out.

### Fun with Markdown and Math!

Here’s a quick example of some cool math supported on this site:

$$
e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0
$$

And a multi-line formula:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& J(w, b) = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m}L(\hat{y}^{(i)}, y^{(i)})
+ \frac{\lambda}{2m} \sum_{l=1}^{L}{||w||}^2_F \\\\
& {||w||}^2_F = \sum_{i = 1}^{n[l]}\sum_{j = 1}^{n[l-1]}(w_{ij})^2
\end{aligned}
$$
