Welcome to my personal webpage!  

I’m Louis Mozart, a PhD researcher specializing in **Class Expression Learning with Multiple Representations**. My work focuses on advancing reasoning and retrieval in ontologies through innovative methods like knowledge graph embeddings, caching algorithms, and embedding-based reasoners.

### A Bit More About Me  

I’ve developed two knowledge graph embedding models and contributed to projects integrating OWL constructs with biological data. My work on embedding-in-function-spaces and degenerate Clifford embeddings has pushed the boundaries of what can be achieved with representation learning in the semantic web.

When not immersed in research, I enjoy playing the guitar, improving my chess skills, and playing football on weekends.
